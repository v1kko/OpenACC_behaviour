Characters in OpenACC
=====================

Char is not a scalar datatype in Fortran according to spec.
Char is an aggregate datatype in Fortran according to spec.
This would make a string an aggregate variable

No restrictions are places on aggregate variable type. 

<TODO> define test to correctly test this
